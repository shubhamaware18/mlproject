# Students Marks Prediction System End to End Implementation

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict students' math scores using a machine learning model. The system takes into account various features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score. The predictive model is implemented as an end-to-end solution, covering data preprocessing, model training, and deployment. The project is developed with the goal of providing a user-friendly web interface for students to input their information and receive predicted math scores.

## Installation

To run the Students Marks Prediction System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shubhamaware18/mlproject

2. Install the required dependencies:
  ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Usage
Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:5000. Fill in the student details and click on "Predict your Maths Score" to see the predicted result.
